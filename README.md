**Zombie Apocalypse** is a mini First Person Shooter made in less than 24 hours for the **VR Game Jam Hackathon** in *East London*  organized by **Realities Center** which consist in building a Virtual Reality game in a very short period of time.

The idea behind **Zombie Apocalypse** was to build a small and intuitive VR experience using the **Oculus Rift** and the **Touch Controllers** while playing with the emotions of the player (*mainly fear and happiness*). 

The project is leveraging the power of **HTML5** and **Javascript** by using **A-Frame**. 

## Before reading the code...
Keep in mind that this is the result of less than one day marathon. Do not expect something beautiful or even optimized. 

## Contribute
If you feel like contributing, please do! Any pull request  would be more than appreciated! 

## Future of the project
The project might receive optimization and additional features in the future. The first goal would be to give a proper structure to the code itself.
